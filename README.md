# Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting ProjectðŸ’°

## Overview
This project aims to utilize the [CoinCap API](https://docs.coincap.io/) to forecast the prices of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. The process involves normalizing the data using Prefect flows and tasks, automating the workflow with Prefect's scheduling feature, and experimenting with MLflow to identify the optimal model for forecasting.
